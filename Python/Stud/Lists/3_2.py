# 3.2 Greetings
# Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just 
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
# person’s name.

## Lists start at index '0 
FriendNames = ['Alberto','Jorge','Yannah','Brandon']

## Print f string using the list and index position. 
print(f"Hey {FriendNames[0]}, How have you been ?")

print(f"Hey {FriendNames[1]}, How have you been ?")
print(f"Hey {FriendNames[2]}, How have you been ?")
print(f"Hey {FriendNames[3]}, How have you been ?")
