      <h2>Purpose of this exercise</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this website is essentially going to be a <br> <strong>get to know everything about Porsche cars</strong>
      as possible. <br> I then plan on including more specific sections in the future <br>for certain cars and specific details.</p>

            <h2>Carbon Ceramic Breaks</h2>
            <p>Original Porsche Brakes are precisely adapted to the engine output and suspension of the relevant model. And that, in turn, guarantees uncompromising safety and absolute performance. Each and every part is tested under the most extreme conditions, to ensure it offers the high material quality and low susceptibility to wear you expect, for the life of your Porsche.</p>

            <h2>Carbon Fiber Everywhere</h2>
            <p>At Porsche, carbon fibre made a fitting debut. In the 1998 race season, the 911 GT1 became the first Porsche to sport a carbon-fibre chassis. Designers saved a full 50 kilograms of weight compared to the previous model – and this promptly led to a magnificent first-second sweep at Le Mans.</p>

            <p>a potent twin-turbo 3.7-liter flat-six, pumping out 572 horsepower in the former and a whopping 640 ponies in the latter variant. That punchy powertrain saw the Turbo S become one of the quickest cars we’ve ever tested, ripping to 60 mph from a standstill in a mere 2.2 seconds and covering a quarter mile in just 9.9 seconds at 138 mph. <br><strong>click the top of the column :)</strong></p>
